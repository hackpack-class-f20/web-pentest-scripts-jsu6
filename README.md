## Environment Overview

I downloaded the Burp Suite software on my MacOS machine. At the first time, I manually set up the proxy on network setting. It worked well on chrome. Then, I found 
there is an embedded browser in Burp Suite. By using it, there is no need to configure the proxy setting. Therefore, it became my first choice when doing ctf challanges.
